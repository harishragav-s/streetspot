# STREETSPOT
Smart Street Parking Management System using CNN based Automated Slot Detection.

## Overview
STREETSPOT is a documentation based project that explains the architecture and workflow of an automated street parking slot detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks. The system processes input images or video frames and identifies parking slot occupancy.

## Features
- Automated street parking slot detection
- Data preprocessing workflow
- CNN based classification
- Real time decision flow
- System diagrams from the project report and PPT

## Project Workflow
1. Image dataset collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. CNN algorithm
4. Model build
5. Slot detection (full or empty)
