# STREETSPOT  
Automated Street Parking Slot Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## About
STREETSPOT is a smart street parking management system designed to identify empty and occupied parking slots using deep learning and computer vision. Traditional parking monitoring relies on manual operators and visual confirmation, which is slow, inaccurate and inefficient. This project overcomes these challenges by using CNN based image processing to automate slot detection through camera feeds. The system processes input images or video frames and produces real time parking occupancy status.

## Features
- Implements convolutional neural network architecture for slot detection.  
- Automated workflow: dataset input, preprocessing, model build and output classification.  
- High scalability for large street parking zones.  
- Low time complexity due to optimized processing pipeline.  
- Supports structured parking output mapping in standard data format.  
- Easily integratable with digital parking boards or mobile apps.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 11 64 bit.  
- Programming Language: Python 3.8 or later.  
- Deep Learning Libraries: TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
- Image Processing: OpenCV for frame processing.  
- IDE: VS Code recommended.  
- Version Control: Git.  
- Additional Libraries: numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
